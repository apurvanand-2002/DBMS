<---JOIN query---->  //for joining 2 (related)tables in MYSQL.
We assume that each of the 2 tables, students and companies have been merged to form a new table ;where students and companies sttributes' are mentioned using dots.

<-----TYPES OF JOIN IN MYSQL----->
1.INNER JOIN 2.LEFT JOIN 3.RIGHT JOIN

1.INNER JOIN:in inner join only those records are fetched which have values corresponding in both the tables. 

SELECT
* 
FROM students 
INNER JOIN 
companies
ON
students.company_id=companies.id;

2.LEFT JOIN:includes all records of left table i.e. here students irrespective of their right record presence.

SELECT
*
FROM students 
LEFT JOIN 
companies
ON
students.company_id=companies.id;

3.RIGHT JOIN:joins all columns of right table i.e. companies table here irrespective of their left column presence.

SELECT
*
FROM 
students 
RIGHT JOIN 
companies
ON
students.company_id=companies.id;
